# Spydis
A Discord bot that makes possible listening in a voice channel and/or repeat the sound received form other similar bots.

Imagine a situation when one "Master" channel wants to listen to people in other channel(s) without being listened in return.

The purpose of this project is to have :
 - One or multiple Listener bot(s) to connect to the concerned channels.
 - One Speaker bot that should receive and play the sound recorded by the Listener(s). This bot will be connected to the "Master" voice channel.
